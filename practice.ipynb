    "# Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "You will conduct experiments with the aim of determining the velocity field of a flow using PIV. The experiments are carried out in a glass aquarium measuring 80 x 35 x 40 cm³. An adaptable setup inside the aquarium allows for generating a recirculating flow. Its modest volume is well-suited for the space constraints of a practical laboratory exercise. However, you will notice that it has consequences on the established flow that you will analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow is generated by 4 Aqua Medic Ecodrift 4.3 pumps. These are propeller pumps commonly used in aquariums. Each pump can produce an adjustable flow rate of up to approximately 4000 l/h, thus creating a controlled recirculating flow in the aquarium."

    "## Image recording\n",
    "\n",
    "The images are acquired by the FlowSense 2M-165 camera, which connects directly to the computer via a USB 3 port, thus integrating the system directly within the computer without requiring an additional acquisition card. This camera offers a resolution of 1920 × 1200 pixels (2.3 megapixels), with a maximum acquisition frequency of 165 frames per second. It is therefore well-suited for time-resolved PIV for slow to moderate flows. Its pixel size is 5.9 μm, and the quantum efficiency of its sensor is greater than 70%, particularly adapted to the wavelengths of green light from lasers or LEDs.\n",
    "It uses a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) sensor, which is widely used in modern PIV systems for its high acquisition rate."

    "## Seeding particles\n",
    "\n",
    "The seeding particles used are polyamide particles (PSP-50, ref. 9080A5011). These particles are produced by polymerization. They are round, but not perfectly spherical. The size distribution (diameter) of each particle is between 30 and 70 μm, with an average of 50 μm. Their density is 1.03 g/cm³, very close to that of water, which therefore limits their sedimentation. Their refractive index is 1.5."
